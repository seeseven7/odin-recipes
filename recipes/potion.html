<h1>MICAH IF YOU'RE HERE DO NOT SHOW THIS TO ANYONE ELSE PLS</h1>
<p>
    Yo guys, Frankster Prankster here. If you're here, it must mean I'm like an awesome developer and you're
    looking at my first few projects. You know what. Good for you. 
    
    Let me set the scene:
    
    I'm doing all of this because I'm kinda bored and stressed in a Queens studio apartment thinking about a
    girl I like while listening to <strong>Etta Jones</strong>. I'm starting to really get into jazz, so thank you Martin for
    listening to Night in Tunisia in that Blloku taxi that one time because now I'm addicted. Anyway... I hope
    I become like a systems engineer or something! I think that would be fun.
</p>

<!-- For the real music people -->
<h3>Anyways listen to this masterpiece when you have time:</h3>
